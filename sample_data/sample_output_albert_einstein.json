  "title": "Alan Turing",
  "summary": "Alan Mathison Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, and theoretical biologist. He was highly influential in the development of computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.",
