        "Guido van Rossum",
        "Larry Wall",
        "Bjarne Stroustrup",
        "James Gosling"
      ],
      "answer": "Guido van Rossum",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Guido van Rossum created Python in the late 1980s and released the first version in 1991. He remained the language's lead developer until stepping down from the role of Benevolent Dictator For Life in 2018."

    {
      "question": "What year was Python first released?",
      "options": [
        "1991",
        "1989",
        "1995",
        "2000"
      ],
      "answer": "1991",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Python was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum as a successor to the ABC programming language. The language emphasized code readability and simplicity from its inception."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a core design philosophy of Python?",
      "options": [
        "Code readability and simplicity",
        "Maximum execution speed",
        "Minimal memory usage",
        "Hardware-level control"
      ],
      "answer": "Code readability and simplicity",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and simplicity, captured in the Zen of Python. The language uses significant whitespace indentation to define code blocks, making it visually clean and easy to understand."

      "question": "What is the name of Python's package installer?",
      "options": [
        "pip",

      "answer": "pip",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "pip (Pip Installs Packages) is the standard package installer for Python, allowing users to install and manage additional libraries and dependencies from the Python Package Index (PyPI)."

    {
      "question": "Which programming paradigms does Python support?",
      "options": [
        "Object-oriented, functional, and procedural",
        "Only object-oriented",
        "Only functional",
        "Only procedural"
      ],
      "answer": "Object-oriented, functional, and procedural",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language that supports object-oriented programming with classes, functional programming with first-class functions, and procedural programming, giving developers flexibility in how they structure their code."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does 'dynamically typed' mean in the context of Python?",
      "options": [
        "Variable types are determined at runtime",
        "Variables must be declared with types",
        "Types cannot be changed",
        "Only numeric types are supported"
      ],
      "answer": "Variable types are determined at runtime",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Python is dynamically typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime rather than compile time. This allows variables to change type during program execution and makes the language more flexible but potentially less safe than statically typed languages."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of these companies heavily uses Python in production?",
      "options": [
        "Google, Instagram, and Dropbox",

        "Only academic institutions"
      ],
      "answer": "Google, Instagram, and Dropbox",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Many major tech companies use Python extensively in production. Google uses it for many internal tools, Instagram's backend is built on Python, and Dropbox's desktop client and server are written in Python."
