   ```

6. [ ] Click "Create Web Service"
7. [ ] Wait for deployment (~5-10 min)
8. [ ] **COPY BACKEND URL** (e.g., `https://ai-quiz-backend.onrender.com`)

   ```
   (Use the backend URL from step above!)

5. [ ] Click "Create Static Site"
6. [ ] Wait for deployment (~3-5 min)

---

## Post-Deployment Testing

1. [ ] Open frontend URL in browser
2. [ ] Test quiz generation with this URL:

   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)
   ```
3. [ ] Verify quiz is generated successfully
4. [ ] Check "History" tab to confirm database is working
5. [ ] Test viewing quiz details by clicking on a quiz
6. [ ] Verify scoring works by taking a quiz

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Render Free Tier:**
- Services sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request wakes it up (~30 seconds delay)
- Completely normal behavior for free tier!

‚ö†Ô∏è **Backend URL:**
- Make sure to use the EXACT backend URL in frontend env variable
- Include `https://` but NO trailing slash
- Example: `https://ai-quiz-backend.onrender.com` ‚úÖ
- NOT: `https://ai-quiz-backend.onrender.com/` ‚ùå

‚ö†Ô∏è **Environment Variables:**
- Never commit `.env` files to GitHub
- Double-check GROQ_API_KEY is correct
- Frontend MUST have backend URL to work

---

## Troubleshooting

**Backend not starting:**
- Check logs in Render Dashboard
- Verify GROQ_API_KEY is set
- Make sure Python version is 3.11+

**Frontend can't connect to backend:**
- Verify `VITE_API_URL` is correct
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure backend is deployed and running

**Quiz generation fails:**
- Check GROQ_API_KEY is valid
- Verify backend logs for errors
- Test backend health endpoint first

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Backend health check returns `{"status": "healthy"}`
‚úÖ Frontend loads without errors
‚úÖ Can generate quiz from Wikipedia URL
‚úÖ Quiz appears in History tab
‚úÖ Can view quiz details
‚úÖ Scoring works correctly

---

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. [ ] Share your deployed app URL!
2. [ ] Test with different Wikipedia articles
3. [ ] Monitor usage (Render dashboard shows metrics)
4. [ ] Consider custom domain (optional)
5. [ ] Update README with your live demo link
